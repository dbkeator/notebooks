      "This document provides an overview of the neuroimaging data model (NI-DM). It describes what led to the development of NI-DM, how it was derived from the W3C Provenance Data Model, and how it relates to other efforts to create metadata and other standards in brain imaging. In particular we note NI-DM's utility in context of other Semantic Web technologies. This document is a part of a collection of notebooks, which highlight the current work related to NI-DM and provide a tutorial introduction to creating and utilizing NI-DM applications."
